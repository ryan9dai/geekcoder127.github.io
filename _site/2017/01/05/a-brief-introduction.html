<p>Well hello there! My name is Fred. Fred Adams.</p>

<p>If you’re reading this and you’re not me, well, I’m very happy that you are!</p>

<p>I’ve spent quite a bit of time making this blog, even if I do have Github Pages (and Jekyll) to help me.</p>

<h2 id="so-who-am-i-anyway">So who am I anyway?</h2>

<p>I’m basically a sort of tech-addict. I like to buy tech, play around with it, and anything else you could possibly think about to do with tech.</p>

<p>You’re probably thinking that I live a pretty depressing life because I just stay indoors 24/7 and play around with tech.</p>

<p>Although that is partly true, I don’t just play around with tech.</p>

<h2 id="i-do-a-lot-of-programming">I do A LOT of programming.</h2>

<p>I mainly do web development, but I also am pretty good at Python and Java.</p>

<p>I work on completely random projects, some of which are actually useful, and others are just… random.</p>

<p>I’m also constantly learning about the new and shiny technologies in the programming world. And also the old technologies that I haven’t gotten around to learning yet.</p>

<p>I honestly can’t guarantee you that my programming is completely top notch, because I’ve only been programming for around 4 years, and counting, of course.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-should-i-listen-to-you-if-you-only-have-4-years-of-experience">So why should I listen to you if you only have 4 years of experience??</h2>

<p>Well, honestly, I don’t know why you should listen to me.</p>

<p>I’m starting this blog is because I read several good blogs myself, and I wanted to give something back to the programmer community.</p>

<p>And even if I only have a few years of experience, I assure you that I will put my best effort into making these posts as easy to read, as easy to understand, and as professional as I possibly can.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-is-this-blog-going-to-work-exactly">So how is this blog going to work exactly?</h2>

<p>Well, I will post on this blog every Friday at 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.</p>

<p>These posts will all be about programming, whether I’m talking about a new project I’m working on, or explaining a new (or old) programming technology.</p>

<h3 id="but-if-youre-not-interested-in-hearing-me-talk-about-random-programming-topics-i-will-post-on-wednesdays-1200-pm-est-every-once-and-a-while">But if you’re not interested in hearing me talk about random programming topics, I will post on Wednesdays (12:00 PM EST) every once and a while.</h3>

<p>Wednesday posts will generally be me ranting about the latest failure Apple product, or maybe why you should really start using VSCode right now.</p>

<h3 id="i-guess-thats-all-for-now">I guess that’s all for now.</h3>
