<h3 id="so-ive-been-doing-this-blog-for-a-few-weeks-now">So I’ve been doing this blog for a few weeks now.</h3>

<p>I’ve definitely learned a lot during those few weeks, and I’d like to make a few improvements to the blog.</p>

<p>But before I make those improvements, I’d like to let you know about what they are.</p>

<p>I’ll also talk about upcoming posts, as well as a few post-series I’m starting.</p>

<h3 id="but-first-id-like-to-thank-you-any-of-you-that-are-reading-this">But first, I’d like to thank you, any of you that are reading this.</h3>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You.</h2>

<p>It really means a lot to me that you are reading this.</p>

<h3 id="okay-with-that-over-with-lets-begin">Okay, with that over with, let’s begin.</h3>

<p>So I feel like I’m not writing on this blog enough.</p>

<p>I mean, I feel like I’m only giving you all a 350 word post every week.</p>

<p>That’s not much.</p>

<p>So, from this week onwards, I’m going to try to make the blog posts longer, and more frequent.</p>

<p>I will still post every Saturday at 9:45 AM EST, but I aim to post on Sunday as well, at the same time.</p>

<p>Also, this is actually my first Wednesday post, and I hope to do more for all of the viewers that aren’t as interested in the programming side of things.</p>

<p>For Wednesday posts, I’ll try to give you all an update on my latest programming projects, and my views on the latest tech out there.</p>

<h3 id="im-also-starting-a-post-series">I’m also starting a post-series.</h3>

<p>So, I’ve been thinking, some of you all might not know much about programming.</p>

<p>Well, I am to teach you all in a short series of posts, which will teach you the fundementals of web development.</p>

<h2 id="im-calling-it-web-development-in-500-words">I’m calling it Web Development in 500 words.</h2>

<p>Every Monday and Tuesday (until the series in finished), I will post a guide about a specific thing in programming.</p>

<p>For example one of these posts will be called HTML in 500 Words.</p>

<p>The series will probably last around 2 or 3 weeks.</p>

<p>I’ve also been working on a few somewhat long posts.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A quick guide to the terminal (git bash)</li>
  <li>Building your own programming language</li>
  <li>Writing your first Machine Learning Program</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="i-hope-this-post-gave-you-a-good-idea-of-whats-happening-in-the-future-of-this-blog">I hope this post gave you a good idea of what’s happening in the future of this blog.</h3>
