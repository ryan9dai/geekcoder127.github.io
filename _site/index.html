Visual Studio Code</h3> <p><img src="img/posts/the-best-text-editor-vscode.png" alt="" /></p> <p>Not to be confused with the popular but very annoying and non-user friendly Visual Studio, VSCode has all of the features of some of the greatest text editors, but with a large array of packages, an extremely large amount of support for syntax highlighting for thousands of languages, and a friendly but featureful interface.</p> <p>VSCode starts up pretty quick, although not as fast as other alternatives (ie. Atom or Sublime), and upon opening, you see a screen where you have a few options. The most useful and most important option is to open a folder or file, which will generally be the current project you’re working on.</p> <p>After opening a folder, you are presented with a toolbar with all of your files, similar to toolbars in most other code editors.</p> <p>VSCode comes preinstalled with syntax highlighting for all of the main programming technologies, but you can also download additional syntax highlighting support for other languages via the package management tab.</p> <p>Along with basic syntax highlighting, Emmet, a popular web development shortcut tool, comes preinstalled with VSCode, which is actually pretty handy in some situations. However, Emmet can easily be installed in many other popular text editors as well.</p> <p>VSCode also comes with a very sophisticated debugging tool, unlike any other. The debugging tool is one of the most useful in VSCode as a whole, and in my opinion, is what separates VSCode from other popular text editors.</p> <p>Additionally, VSCode was built using Electron, the tool that Github created that allows desktop apps to be built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Nodejs). This means that the VSCode settings are actually in a JSON format, which makes the setting a lot easier to edit, as the format is familiar to most (if not all) web developers.</p> <p>All in all, VSCode comes with all of the great features of all of the other popular text editors, but is faster, more sophisticated, and updated regularly.</p> <p>Also, it is my main text editor.</p> <h3 id="2-atom">2. Atom</h3> <p><img src="img/posts/the-best-text-editor-atom.png" alt="" /></p> <p>Atom was created by Github not so long ago, and is very similar to VSCode in several ways.</p> <p>First of all, Atom has and extremely well designed user interface, with easy to edit settings, and a wide amount of keyboard shortcut options.</p> <p>Atom also has a large community of people building Atom packages and themes, which are easy to install (and uninstall) via the packages and themes tabs.</p> <p>Among these packages and themes, Emmet is available, of course.</p> <p>Not long ago, the Atom team developed a very useful package for Atom, called Atom Teletype.</p> <p>Atom Teletype allows developers to collaborate on code in real time, giving programmers a “Google Docs” type experience.</p> <p>Ultimately, I would recommend Atom to semi-experienced developers that are looking for a text editor to make programming significantly faster, but isn’t too overkill.</p> <h3 id="3-sublime-text">3. Sublime Text</h3> <p><img src="img/posts/the-best-text-editor-sublime.png" alt="" /></p> <p>Sublime Text is the most lightweight but still functional editor out there.</p> <p>Sublime boots up lighting fast, and has all the basic tools any developer needs - a file management toolbar, quick file multitasking, and most of all, easy code editing. The Sublime Text user interface is extremely simple and easy to use, but with that said, Sublime isn’t that sophisticated.</p> <p>The package management system is honestly really annoying and complicated to understand (and hard to find), and Sublime only supports a few languages for syntax highlighting.</p> <p>I would say that Sublime Text is the best text editor for beginners, as it is simple to use, but doesn’t have many advanced features.</p> <h3 id="4-brackets">4. Brackets</h3> <p><img src="img/posts/the-best-text-editor-brackets.png" alt="" /></p> <p>Brackets was created by Adobe a few years back, and it some pretty great features that really separate from most other text editors.</p> <p>On its own, Brackets has all of the basic tools of a text editor. It has good syntax highlighting, a whole library of themes and packages, as well as a simple user interface.</p> <p>Along with all of these features, it has a few unique ones.</p> <p>First, Brackets comes with a live editor preinstalled.</p> <p>Basically, you can click a button, and live view of your website is displayed on Google Chrome.</p> <p>Upon changing the current file, the live view will reload automatically.</p> <p>On top of that, the live view highlights the HTML element that your cursor is on in Brackets, so that you can see what you are changing, in real time.</p> <p>Another great feature in Brackets is the “Inline Support,” as Adobe calls it.</p> <p>Essentially, all you have to do is press Ctrl-E (or Cmd-E) and you can view all of the CSS affecting the HTML element your cursor in currently on. This can be useful if you want to quickly edit the styles of an element without having to go to your CSS file and find the style declaration.</p> <p>Overall, Brackets is a pretty great text editor that I would definitely recommend for beginners because of its ease of use, and it’s pretty cool unique features.</p> <h3 id="5-webstorm">5. Webstorm</h3> <p>Webstorm is probably the best text editor on this list. It has great support for debugging, a library of thousands of packages, amazing syntax highlighting support, and a bunch of other really useful features.</p> <h4 id="right-now-you-might-be-thinking-why-didnt-you-put-webstorm-at-1">Right now, you might be thinking “Why didn’t you put Webstorm at #1?”</h4> <p>Well, a license for Webstorm costs $130 per year, and honestly, the extra features that Webstorm has compared to VSCode aren’t really worth $130 per year.</p> <p>If you’re already a successful and experienced web developer with a couple hundred bucks to spare, Webstorm could be for you.</p> <p>Jetbrains, the creator of Webstorm also has a variety of other IDEs, and a license for all of them is only $600, so if you do a lot of programming in a large array of languages, you could simply just pay for the full license, and get a code editor for each of the languages you use.</p> <p>Jetbrains also updates Webstorm and other editors regularly, and many top-notch companies, such as Twitter, Valve, and HP use their products as their main code editors.</p> <h3 id="so-thats-my-list">So, that’s my list!</h3> <p>That’s all for my list of best text editors.</p> <p>As I said earlier, I suggest you look at all of the features of each editor and choose the one that you like the most, because, as much as I hate to say it, my opinion is not fact.</p> <h3 id="well-thats-all-for-this-week">Well, that’s all for this week.</h3> <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Thanks For Reading, and I'll see you next week!<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

Fred Adams.</p> <p>If you’re reading this and you’re not me, well, I’m very happy that you are!</p> <p>I’ve spent quite a bit of time making this blog, even if I do have Github Pages (and Jekyll) to help me.</p> <h2 id="so-who-am-i-anyway">So who am I anyway?</h2> <p>I’m basically a sort of tech-addict. I like to buy tech, play around with it, and anything else you could possibly think about to do with tech.</p> <p>You’re probably thinking that I live a pretty depressing life because I just stay indoors 24/7 and play around with tech.</p> <p>Although that is partly true, I don’t just play around with tech.</p> <h2 id="i-do-a-lot-of-programming">I do A LOT of programming.</h2> <p>I mainly do web development, but I also am pretty good at Python and Java.</p> <p>I work on completely random projects, some of which are actually useful, and others are just… random.</p> <p>I’m also constantly learning about the new and shiny technologies in the programming world. And also the old technologies that I haven’t gotten around to learning yet.</p> <p>I honestly can’t guarantee you that my programming is completely top notch, because I’ve only been programming for around 4 years, and counting, of course.</p> <h2 id="so-why-should-i-listen-to-you-if-you-only-have-4-years-of-experience">So why should I listen to you if you only have 4 years of experience??</h2> <p>Well, honestly, I don’t know why you should listen to me.</p> <p>I’m starting this blog because I read several good blogs myself, and I wanted to give something back to the programmer community.</p> <p>And even if I only have a few years of experience, I assure you that I will put my best effort into making these posts as easy to read, as easy to understand, and as professional as I possibly can.</p> <h2 id="so-how-is-this-blog-going-to-work-exactly">So how is this blog going to work exactly?</h2> <p>Well, I will post on this blog every Saturday at 9:45 PM Eastern Standard Time.</p> <p>These posts will all be about programming, whether I’m talking about a new project I’m working on, or explaining a new (or old) programming technology.</p> <h3 id="but-if-youre-not-interested-in-hearing-me-talk-about-random-programming-topics-i-will-post-on-wednesdays-1200-pm-est-every-once-in-a-while">But if you’re not interested in hearing me talk about random programming topics, I will post on Wednesdays (12:00 PM EST) every once in a while.</h3> <p>Wednesday posts will generally be me ranting about the latest Apple product, or maybe why you should really start using VSCode right now.</p> <h3 id="i-guess-thats-all-for-now">I guess that’s all for now.</h3> <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"&lt;h1&gt;Thanks For Reading!&lt;/h1&gt;"</span><span class="p">);</span>
