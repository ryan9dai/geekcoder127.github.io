``` javascript
console.log("Hello World.");
```

Well hello there! My name is Fred. Fred Adams.

If you're reading this and you're not me, well, I'm very happy that you are!

I've spent quite a bit of time making this blog, even if I do have Github Pages (and Jekyll) to help me.

## So who am I anyway?

I’m basically a sort of tech-addict. I like to buy tech, play around with it, and anything else you could possibly think about to do with tech.

You’re probably thinking that I live a pretty depressing life because I just stay indoors 24/7 and play around with tech.

Although that is partly true, I don’t just play around with tech.

## I do A LOT of programming.

I mainly do web development, but I also am pretty good at Python and Java.

I work on completely random projects, some of which are actually useful, and others are just... random.

I’m also constantly learning about the new and shiny technologies in the programming world. And also the old technologies that I haven’t gotten around to learning yet.

I honestly can’t guarantee you that my programming is completely top notch, because I’ve only been programming for around 4 years, and counting, of course.

## So why should I listen to you if you only have 4 years of experience??

Well, honestly, I don’t know why you should listen to me.

I’m starting this blog is because I read several good blogs myself, and I wanted to give something back to the programmer community.

And even if I only have a few years of experience, I assure you that I will put my best effort into making these posts as easy to read, as easy to understand, and as professional as I possibly can.

## So how is this blog going to work exactly?

Well, I will post on this blog every Saturday at 9:45 PM Eastern Standard Time.

These posts will all be about programming, whether I’m talking about a new project I’m working on, or explaining a new (or old) programming technology.

### But if you're not interested in hearing me talk about random programming topics, I will post on Wednesdays (12:00 PM EST) every once and a while.

Wednesday posts will generally be me ranting about the latest failure Apple product, or maybe why you should really start using VSCode right now.

### I guess that’s all for now.

``` javascript
document.write("<h1>Thanks For Reading!</h1>");
