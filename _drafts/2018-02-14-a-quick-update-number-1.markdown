### So I've been doing this blog for a few weeks now.

I've definitely learned a lot during those few weeks, and I'd like to make a few improvements to the blog.

But before I make those improvements, I'd like to let you know about what they are.

I'll also talk about upcoming posts, as well as a few post-series I'm starting.

### But first, I'd like to thank you, any of you that are reading this.

## Thank You.

It really means a lot to me that you are reading this.

### Okay, with that over with, let's begin.

So I feel like I'm not writing on this blog enough.

I mean, I feel like I'm only giving you all a 350 word post every week.

That's not much.

So, from this week onwards, I'm going to try to make the blog posts longer, and more frequent.

I will still post every Saturday at 9:45 AM EST, but I aim to post on Sunday as well, at the same time.

Also, this is actually my first Wednesday post, and I hope to do more for all of the viewers that aren't as interested in the programming side of things.

For Wednesday posts, I'll try to give you all an update on my latest programming projects, and my views on the latest tech out there.

### I'm also starting a post-series.

So, I've been thinking, some of you all might not know much about programming.

Well, I am to teach you all in a short series of posts, which will teach you the fundementals of web development.

## I'm calling it Web Development in 500 words.

Every Monday and Tuesday (until the series in finished), I will post a guide about a specific thing in programming.

For example one of these posts will be called HTML in 500 Words.

The series will probably last around 2 or 3 weeks.

I've also been working on a few somewhat long posts.

These include:

- A quick guide to the terminal (git bash)
- Building your own programming language
- Writing your first Machine Learning Program

### I hope this post gave you a good idea of what's happening in the future of this blog.
